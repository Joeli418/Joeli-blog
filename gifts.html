        <h3 id="dontGet">Gifts that you shouldn't get - I will not appreciate</h3>
        <ul style=" margin: 10px 0;">
            <li>Do not get me any meat or animal product such as leather</li>
            <li>Animal product that does not involve the killing of animals are okay</li>
            <li>You should not buy me any pets or gift that forces me to take responsibility</li>
            <li>Don't get things that violates my moral values</li>
            <li>Of course, don't pick something from the trash can and give it to me.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3>Gifts that are less preferred</h3>
        <ul style=" margin: 10px 0;">
            <li>Try not to get me clothings, unless you know very well on what I want. I've got a lot of clothes in the closet.</li>
            <li>Try not to give me food. I prefer long lasting gifts which reminds me of the sender.</li>
            <li>For the same reason as above, try not to get me gift cards.</li>
            <li>If you know I have something, try not to get something for me to replace it.</li>
            <li>If you are planning to give me books, just know that I have a Kindle. You can ask me first or get a digital copy.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3>Safe gifts to get</h3>
            <p>As mentioned above, a good gift for me is something that will last and remind me of the sender. If you are unsure of what
                to get me, something small and long lasting is suffice. Bonus points if it better reminds me of you. </p>
                <p>Digital gifts are okay. For the same reason above, don't get subscription gifts.</p>
            <p>I value the thought put into a gift over the actual gift itself. Hence just a card is also a safe option.</p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>Budget</h3>
            <p>
               I don't mind cheap gifts. Try not to spend over 50 AUD on a gift for me. 
            </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Conclude</h3>
            <p>
               As long as your gift is not the ones I listed as <a href="#dontGet">"Gifts that you shouldn't get" </a> ,
                I will appreciate whatever you get me. Since you didn't have to get me anything.
               
            </p>
