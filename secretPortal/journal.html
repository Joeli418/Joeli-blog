            <h3> Entry 1 </h3>
            <!-- 29/7/2023 -->
            <p> 
                I've just created a Journal for this domain. Why am I even putting my personal domain here? <br>
                I was just thinking,
                this isn't something I don't want to share, it's just something I don't want to bring up initiatively.
            </p>

            <h3> Entry 2 </h3>
            <!-- 31/7/2023 -->
            <p> 
                It really sucks to be ignored. It feels like I'm being seperated from everyone else and out of the world. 
                I don't know if it's done intentionally or not.
            </p>

            <h3> Entry 3 </h3>
            <!-- 1/8/2023 -->
            <p> 
                It's genuienly upseting to know that most people are not compassionate for other people. I've realized
                that alot of people in this world only cares for themselves. Some only care for people who they like.
                If everyone cared about each other, wouldn't the world be a so much better place to live in?
            </p>

            <h3> Entry 4 </h3>
            <!-- 7/8/2023 -->
            <p> 
                Every second, I'm being pushed one step closer to a point where I don't exist. It makes me feel helpless.
                What even is time?
            </p>

            <h3> Entry 5 </h3>
            <!-- 9/8/2023 -->
            <p> 
                I don't want to die. But if I'm asked, do i want to live for eternity? Eternity is a strong word. I can
                max out every skill and experience, keep waiting and waiting everyday. Do i really want to live by then? 
                This contradiction is so scary.

            <h3> Entry 6 </h3>
            <!-- 13/8/2023 -->
            <p> 
                There's alot of things I wanted to do. I want to double mechanical engineering. I want to become finacially
                self sustainable sooner. I want to program a game relating to this domain. I want to build projects, make
                impact on the world, etc. But with the limited amount of time I have, can I really pull these off? My times
                are actually so restless.

            <p> 
                Having a partner to share thoughts with and hug would be really ideal for me. It's like this one missing
                part in my life I've never properly found. But I can't just go and pick a random person to be my partner.
                Is finding someone with the same moral value difficult?

            <p> 
                I try really hard to make people happy, but here's the thing. If my friends ever go against me, I have
                a plan. If my family ever go against me, I have a plan as well. But if the whole world ever go against me,
                then what am I even doing here?

                This world is big and beautiful. I want to be out there with my friends. But there's alot of stuff I want 
                to do and achieve at home. Can these co-exist?

                We are living under the mercy from people with power. When power is under the hands of someone unethical,
                we all suffer.

                Death is scary, because it's so different from what I'm experiencing right at this moment. No one can 
                describe it. This is so upseting. That's one of the reason I'd like a partner for hugs.

                If I keep trying my best to be rightious. People have no reason to be mad at me or blame me for
                me being the wrong doing, even if i do. They need to ammend their ethics before they come and judge me. <br>
                I hope some people know that. I try very hard.

                I've not always been a full extrovert. But one of the reason I try to know new people is because, 
                I would more likely to find great people. <br>
                The world is big, and we'll never experience it if we don't go out and see them.

                I've once tried to convince myself it's okay not to be a vegetarian. It's just how nature works where
                some animals have to eat other animals. But, I've always feared death. Why would I want these animals
                to experience the same? And since I have the ability to become vegetarian, why shouldn't I?

                What I'm seeing and feeling, what are they? If our conciousness is really formed by matter, shouldn't 
                we be robots roaming around the earth? Us human have discovered so much that we think we know

                I often tell people not to worry about their mark and try to convince them they shouldn't worry abou
                them. ironically, I'm the one who worries about my grades. Mainly because I'm acadmeically focused.
                And if I don't do well, I feel... well... useless.
