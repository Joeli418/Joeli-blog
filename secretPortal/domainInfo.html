            <h2>General</h2>
			<p>
				This place is a virtual place where I imagine I physically exist. The sole purpose is to self support 
                and make myself happy without relying too heavily on other real people. This domain gives me an extra place
                to go to and understand myself abit better.
			</p>
			
			
            <h2>Why does this place exist?</h2>
            <p>
                I go through alot of existential crisis. Sometimes, I imagine when I die or when the world ends, I will be
                seperated from my friends for eternity. So I have came up with two solutions:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Mutual trust. <br> 
                        If my friend trust my love for him/her for eternity, and I trust him/her as much, we
                        will be mentally connected despite being seperated for eternity. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My personal domain. <br>
                        In this place, all the characters are just different aspect of myself. If I can
                        make different parts of me an individual, these characters are essentially not seperable from myself.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                There are times where unexpected sad things that happens. And sometimes, I feel sad because I 
                felt excluded and not taken care of. From time to time I get lonely. Either way
                I could come here and get some
                moral support from the characters. I do have alot of very good friends, but I don't have any 
                specific people I always talk to. I don't blame anyone, but I'm probably abit demanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                 In the real world, unfortunately, alot of people are often not compassionate. And alot of people cannot
                 fully understand me and care. Since characters here are essentially myself, they will understand me. 
            </p>
            <h2>Who are these characters?</h2>
            <p>
                These characters are drawn and designed by me to match my likes. Each individual represents a 
                different aspect of myself. All together, these characters are just myself. It is arguable that
                these characters are real as they are just me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having these characters does not mean I don't care about real people. I care about real people,
                alot. And I want everyone to be happy. These characters are just there for me.
            </p>

            <h2>What do I do here?</h2>
            <p>
                I occassionally visit at night, when I'm less distracted by my work. The settings for this domain is basically
                whatever I can imagine, and I can basically do anything, such as flying. I would come in here and hug
                my characters, or maybe go on adventurous jorneys with them. We could go to candy worlds and sky islands.
                We play together, have fun together and support each other.
            </p>

            <h2>Stopping me from coming here</h2>
            <p>
                If you want me to focus on the real world more, a good thing to do is to text / talk to me often and observe in daily
                interactions. Sometimes I could feel lonely even when the area is crowded and during conversation. Don't ignore
                me and don't be mean to me. Try to understand my moral values.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't want anyone to invest too much on me, that's why I have this domain. But if anyone cares about me, 
                I will be very grateful for them. I value people who cares.
            </p>
