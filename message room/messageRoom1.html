			Quick message,
			I've soldered on an extra register on top of the 3 register we already have.<br>

			I'm a bit consumed over this project, so
			I hope you can solder the entire ALU. Which means alot of trust! Don't let me down.<br><br>
			Everything you need is in the locker 36. here's the list of them.
			<ul>
				<li>Hand held oscilloscope</li>
				<li>My IC box</li>
				<li>IC holders</li>
				<li>blu tack</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><u>Handheld oscilloscope</u></h3>
			for the oscilloscope, switch to V to measure voltage across black and red. <b>Hold R</b> to enter oscilloscope mode.
			you can adjust the time and scale by pressing button corresponding to the screen. <br><br>
			rotate to Î© to measure resistance. You can use this as continuity check, i.e. checking if ICs are connected together

			<h3><u>IC box</u></h3>
			here are the IC you will potentially need:
			<ul>
				<li>74 00 (quad NAND gate)</li>
				<li>74 74 (dual flip flop)</li>
				<li>74 32 (quad OR gate)</li>
				<li>74 86 (quad XOR gate)</li>
				<li>74 08 (quad AND gate)</li>
				<li>74 151 (8 bit MUX)</li>
			</ul>
			you can google the chip number if you're not sure.
			<br><br>
			For other things such as wires, I think you should be able to find them in the makerspace.
			If not, please text me and I'll grab some from the lab trashbox.

		<div class="textbox" style="text-align: left;">
			Here are the things you want to do.
			<br><br>
			try connecting the multiplexer first with the <b>FIRST 3 BIT of the DIP switch</b>. <br>
			The DIP switch is configured as following
			<ul>
				<li>bit 1-3: instruction bit</li>
				<li>bit 5-7: designation register</li>
				<li>bit 9-11: input register 1</li>
				<li>bit 13-15: input register 2</li>
			</ul>
			the rest of the bit should serve no purpose
			<br>
			<br>
			try making the MOVE instruction first with 000. Make sure it works.
			The computer should work as soon as you have one instruction. 
			MOVE should be the easiest one, you just need to put input 1 (green line from image below)
			into the input of the multiplexer
			<br><br>
			then try making AND and OR or any other bitwise instruction you want to make. If possible, try to 
			minimize the amount of chip used. e.g. use NAND implementation. But also, if other instruction also
			requires the use of AND or OR, then dont use NAND implementation.
			<br><br>
			If you're really fast, then try to do the ADD and 2's complement instruction.
			<b style="color: rgb(255, 122, 122);;">before you do the 2's complement, please text me!!</b> My schematic for ADD
			can be found in our chat history, but if I were you, I would double check if my schematic is correct.
			<br><br>
			Finally, if you're very confident, you can do a shift instruction. But i reckon we should save this for the holiday
			<br><br>
			we have 8 instruction we can make.
			<ul>
				<li>000: MOVE</li>
				<li>001: AND</li>
				<li>010: ORR</li>
				<li>011: your choice</li>
				<li>100: your choice</li>
				<li>101: ADD</li>
				<li>110: 2's complement</li>
				<li>111: Shift</li>

			</ul>

                        <br>
                        <h3> Note </h3>
                        The blue line should be connected <b>at the same node</b> with the resitor (2k)<br><br>
						The computer should work as soon as you solder the MOVE function on<br><br>
						see that big capacitor on the top right? that one's not soldered. it's for you to use.<br>
						right now, a very small capacitor is used, so the operation happens almost instantly.<br>
						If you want to slow down the clock, replace the small capacitor with the big capacitor.
                        <br>

        <div class="textbox" style="text-align: left;">
			I'll visit you in the makerspace if you're there at roughly 6:10 pm.<br><br>
			One final thing tho, I'm most likely not going to do a whole lot more solder during the remainder of the term.<br>
			But I can help you out. Just text me. I'm on campus everyday. <br>
			You are free to come to my place during the weekends. Just let me know beforehand. 
			<br><br>
			Be careful when you solder, because i know desoldering is very time consuming.<br>
			note the IC pins positions are inverted when you flip over to solder it, and it's very counterintuitive.<br>
			make sure you double check.
			<br><br>
			At the same time, dont be afraid to mess things up. And be creative. <br>
			If there's something you think might work out, just do it. <br>
			This project is yours, and we'll never know if it works if you don't do it.
			<br><br>
			text me if you have any concerns.
